# Competitive Analysis - advice.ai
*Prepared: October 2025*

## Executive Summary

advice.ai operates in the UHNW wealth planning software market, competing primarily with estate planning platforms (Vanilla, Luminary, Wealth.com) and adjacent with broader family office software (Addepar, Asora, Masttro). Our key differentiator is the **comprehensive integration** of estate planning, tax strategies, insurance, net worth, and cash flow in a single platform with AI-powered knowledge mapping - a capability none of our direct competitors fully offer.

**Key Strengths**:
- Largest scale (750+ wealth management firms)
- Ranked #1 in T3/Inside Information survey

## Adjacent Competitors

### 4. Addepar
**Positioning**: Portfolio management and data aggregation for UHNW

**Relevance**: Addepar handles portfolio/asset management but doesn't integrate estate planning, tax strategies, or insurance in a holistic way. Complementary, not competitive.

**Key Issue**: Expensive, complex, AUM-based pricing. Many firms seeking alternatives.

**Opportunity**: We can position as the **strategic planning layer** that sits above or alongside Addepar's asset management.

---

### 5. Asora / Masttro / Family Office Platforms
**Positioning**: Full family office management software

**Relevance**: These platforms handle operational/administrative aspects of family offices but lack the sophisticated planning intelligence and AI-powered insights we offer.

**Opportunity**: We focus on **planning sophistication**, not operational management. Different use cases.
