# Brand Guideline

Ultra-high-net-worth families don't have simple financial details. They have complex ecosystems spanning generations and multiple entities with varying ownership, roles and responsibilities.  They have customized strategies integrated across estate, tax, insurance and net worth that are designed to meet family goals, comply with complex Federal and State laws and tax codes.  They have a network of professionals supporting this ecosystem, managing various aspects and recommending refinements and improvements.  diverse asset classes, and intricate tax structures. Yet most wealth management platforms force advisors to piece together incomplete data from several disconnected sources.

Our platform doesn’t just collect data-it connects the dots.

Our platform doesn’t just show a picture-it shows a movie with changing perspectives, on the past, present and into the future.

The Family Ontology defines relationships and properties between the sophisticated data.  It transforms simple classifications into complex networks, and enhances understanding of how different data points relate to one another.

The Knowledge Maps are the visual representations of the complex Family Ontology, empowering understanding, illustrating value created and uncovering hidden patterns within the data.

The Semantic Interpretation and Reasoning enhances the understanding of context and meaning behind the data, allowing for nuanced queries and identification of custom opportunities.

AI is used across the system to create scale and speed, to identify patterns, flag risks and to surface opportunities that would take human analysts weeks to discover.

For the first time, advisors can see the entire family financial ecosystem in one view, enabling truly holistic advice that optimizes outcomes across generations.

See the ontology of the family, their:

- multiple generations
- professional teams across disciplines
- estate and legal structures
- roles and responsibilities
- total net worth
- all assets and liabilities, reported and not-reported, liquid and illiquid
- complex ownership
- transactional cash flow
- insurance details and performance
- risk management
- Estate tax
- Income tax
- Tax data
- Strategies interconnecting all of the above

The result? Advisors move from data gatherers to strategic architects. Families make informed decisions faster. And multi-generational wealth strategies actually work as intended.

Our clients report 40% reduction in advice preparation time and 3x improvement in family engagement with their wealth strategies.
