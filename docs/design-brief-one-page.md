# Design Brief: advice.ai One-Page Website
*Three Options for Initial Launch*

---

## Design Philosophy

Based on competitive analysis and brand guidelines:

**Visual Strategy**: Sophisticated, distinctive, purpose-built for UHNW audience
- Avoid blue/white generic SaaS aesthetic (used by all competitors)
- Incorporate knowledge mapping visualizations as signature element
- Use subtle, meaningful animations (Resend-style, not flashy)
- Professional elegance over startup energy

**Messaging Strategy**: Collaborative sophistication vs. efficiency claims
- Lead with complexity as specialty, not simplification
- Focus on elevated advice, not time savings
- Use "let's," "together," "partnership" language
- Demonstrate deep UHNW understanding

**Differentiation**: What competitors don't show
- Holistic integration (estate + tax + insurance + net worth + cash flow)
- Family Ontology and Knowledge Maps (unique)
- Exclusive UHNW multi-generational focus
- Semantic understanding, not just digitization

---

## Three One-Page Options

### **OPTION A: "The Ontology"**
*Lead with visual knowledge mapping - show the "movie, not the picture"*

#### Visual Concept
An animated, interactive knowledge graph as the hero element - inspired by Resend's Rubik's cube but showing interconnected family wealth elements (generations, entities, strategies, assets). As it rotates/animates, different facets illuminate to show relationships.

#### Page Flow

**1. Hero Section** (Full viewport)
- Left: Rotating value propositions in sync with knowledge graph animation
  - "See the ontology of the family"
  - "Connect estate, tax, and insurance strategies"
  - "Transform complexity into clarity"
- Right: 3D animated knowledge graph showing interconnections
- CTA: "Request Demo" | "Explore the Platform"

**2. The Challenge** (Split screen)
- Left: Traditional approach visualization (scattered documents, siloed systems)
- Right: advice.ai approach (integrated knowledge map)
- Copy: "Ultra-high-net-worth families don't have simple financial details..."

**3. Platform Capabilities** (Card grid with hover reveals)
- Family Ontology (show network visualization)
- Knowledge Maps (show visual representation)
- Semantic Reasoning (show insight examples)
- AI-Powered Intelligence (show pattern discovery)
- Each card expands on hover to show depth

**4. Integration Showcase** (Horizontal scroll/carousel)
- Visualize how advice.ai integrates across dimensions:
  - Multi-generational families
  - Professional teams
  - Estate & legal structures
  - All assets & liabilities
  - Insurance strategies
  - Tax optimization
  - Estate planning
- Show these as interconnected nodes, not separate modules

**5. Results** (Stats with subtle animations)
- 40% reduction in advice preparation time
- 3x improvement in family engagement
- 100% integrated wealth visibility
- Context: "Advisors move from data gatherers to strategic architects"

**6. Who We Serve** (Three columns)
- Family Offices
- UHNW Teams & CPAs
- The Advisory Team (attorneys, insurance advisors)
- Clear, sophisticated copy for each

**7. Call to Action** (Clean, centered)
- "Partner with the specialists who understand UHNW complexity"
- Form: "Request a Demo" (Name, Email, Firm, AUM range)
- Or: "Schedule a Conversation"

#### Color Palette
- Deep navy/charcoal (sophistication)
- Accent: Warm gold or deep teal (wealth, intelligence)
- Neutrals: Off-white, warm grays
- Avoid: Pure blue (too common), bright colors (not sophisticated)

#### Typography
- Serif headings (sophistication, trust)
- Sans-serif body (modern clarity)
- Ample whitespace

**Pros**:
- Highly differentiated visually
- Demonstrates our unique capability (knowledge mapping)
- Memorable and distinctive
- Sophisticated without being stuffy

**Cons**:
- Requires complex animation development
- May be too abstract for some visitors
- Higher development complexity

### **OPTION B: "The Transformation"**
*Before/After narrative showing the advisor and family experience*

#### Visual Concept
A storytelling approach that walks through the transformation advice.ai enables, using a side-by-side "Before/With advice.ai" comparison throughout. Clean, editorial design with strategic use of diagrams and data visualizations.

#### Page Flow

**1. Hero Section** (Full viewport, minimal)
- Headline: "Sophisticated Wealth Planning for Multi-Generational Families"
- Subhead: "AI-powered intelligence meets deep UHNW expertise"
- Background: Subtle, abstract visualization of interconnected nodes (non-animated version)
- CTA: "See the Transformation" (scroll) | "Request Demo"

**2. The UHNW Reality** (Full-width)
- Large, impactful copy block:
  - "Ultra-high-net-worth families have complex ecosystems spanning generations..."
  - "Multiple entities with varying ownership..."
  - "Customized strategies across estate, tax, insurance, and net worth..."
  - "A network of professionals supporting this ecosystem..."
- Visual: Diagram showing complexity (multiple generations, entities, advisors, strategies)

**3. The Problem** (Before state - darker background)
- Grid of pain points with icons:
  - Information scattered across systems
  - Manual effort to piece together complete picture
  - Sophisticated analysis too time-intensive

## Recommendation

Based on competitive analysis and brand positioning, I recommend a **hybrid approach**:

### **Recommended: Option A + C Hybrid**
**"The Ontology" (Option A visual signature) + "The Specialist" (Option C positioning)**

**Why**:
1. **Visual Differentiation**: Knowledge graph animation (Option A) is unique in the market
2. **Brand Alignment**: Exclusive positioning (Option C) matches our UHNW specialization
3. **Memorable**: Combines distinctive visual with clear positioning
4. **Competitive**: Nothing like this exists in the competitive set

**How to Combine**:
- Use Option A's animated knowledge graph as hero visual signature
- Apply Option C's sophisticated, minimal design aesthetic
- Lead with specialization messaging from Option C
- Include knowledge mapping deep-dive from both
- Keep overall structure clean and focused (Option C) but with visual wow (Option A)

### Page Structure (Hybrid)
1. Hero: Animated knowledge graph + "Purpose-Built for UHNW Complexity"
2. Why Specialization: The UHNW reality (Option C approach)
3. What We See: Grid of capabilities (Option C)
4. Family Ontology: Deep-dive with interactive visual (Option A)
5. Integration: How we connect the dots (Option A visualization)
6. Who We Serve: Three audiences (Option C approach)
7. Transformation: Before/After outcomes (Option B element)
8. CTA: Partnership-focused (Option C tone)

## Next Steps

1. **Select Preferred Option** (or hybrid approach)
2. **Define Animation Complexity** (MVP vs. full vision)
3. **Create Wireframes** for selected option
4. **Source/Create Assets** (knowledge graph designs, diagrams)
5. **Develop Content** (refined copy based on selected structure)
6. **Build & Iterate**

---

## Technical Considerations

**For Option A or Hybrid**:
- Knowledge graph animation: Use Framer Motion + Three.js or similar
- Consider starting with 2D animated SVG, evolve to 3D later
- Ensure animations are performant (60fps)
- Fallback for reduced motion preferences

**For All Options**:
- Optimize for Core Web Vitals
- Mobile-responsive (especially important for knowledge graphs)
- Fast load times (critical for sophisticated audience)
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)

**Phase 1 MVP Simplifications**:
- Static knowledge graph with subtle CSS animations instead of full 3D
- Fewer sections (combine some)
- Standard form instead of custom qualification
- Can enhance over time

---

## Content Priorities

Regardless of option selected, ensure:

1. **Avoid Generic Claims**: Don't compete on "time savings" or "efficiency"
2. **Demonstrate Understanding**: Show we know UHNW complexity
3. **Lead with Differentiation**: Family Ontology, holistic integration
4. **Sophisticated Tone**: Partnership language, collaborative approach
5. **Clear Audience**: UHNW-only, not trying to serve everyone
6. **Visual Distinction**: Don't look like competitors (no blue/white SaaS)
